final-project-black-mirror created by GitHub Classroom

Travel Advisor is an app in which a user can search for different destinations and find it's popular attractions.
Rating is provided for each attraction. A User can add reviews for a particular attraction.

## Before You Begin
Before you begin we recommend you read about the basic building blocks that assemble a MEAN.JS application:
* MongoDB - Go through [MongoDB Official Website](http://mongodb.org/) and proceed to their [Official Manual](http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/), which should help you understand NoSQL and MongoDB better.
* Express - The best way to understand express is through its [Official Website](http://expressjs.com/), which has a [Getting Started](http://expressjs.com/starter/installing.html) guide, as well as an [ExpressJS](http://expressjs.com/en/guide/routing.html) guide for general express topics. You can also go through this [StackOverflow Thread](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8144214/learning-express-for-node-js) for more resources.
* AngularJS - Angular's [Official Website](http://angularjs.org/) is a great starting point. You can also use [Thinkster Popular Guide](http://www.thinkster.io/), and [Egghead Videos](https://egghead.io/).
* Node.js - Start by going through [Node.js Official Website](http://nodejs.org/) and this [StackOverflow Thread](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2353818/how-do-i-get-started-with-node-js), which should get you going with the Node.js platform in no time.


## Prerequisites
Make sure you have installed all of the following prerequisites on your development machine:
* Git - [Download & Install Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads). OSX and Linux machines typically have this already installed.
* Node.js - [Download & Install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and the npm package manager. If you encounter any problems, you can also use this [GitHub Gist](https://gist.github.com/isaacs/579814) to install Node.js.
* MongoDB - [Download & Install MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/downloads), and make sure it's running on the default port (27017).


### Cloning The GitHub Repository
The recommended way to get the project is to use git to directly clone:

https://github.com/neu-mis-info6150-spring-2018/final-project-black-mirror.git

## Quick Install
```bash
$ npm install
```

This command does a few things:
* First it will install the dependencies needed for the application to run.
* If you're running in a development environment, it will then also install development dependencies needed for testing and running your application.
* When the npm packages install process is over, npm will initiate a bower install command to install all the front-end modules needed for the application
* To update these packages later on, just run `npm update`

## Running Your Application

Run command -node server.js on backend folder using command line to start the server at localhost:3000.

Run command- npm start on frontend folder to access the application on localhost:4200.
